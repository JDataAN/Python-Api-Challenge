# Python-Api-Challenge
Discovering Weather Secrets & Planning Your Ultimate Vacation!


Have you ever wondered how the weather changes as you travel the world? Or fantasized about the perfect vacation with ideal weather conditions? This Python project is your ticket to unraveling these mysteries!


This repository is filled with Python code that will change the way you view weather.


Part 1: Weather Detective


Become a weather sleuth! We'll use Python to explore the relationship between weather and latitude in cities worldwide. With the help of the citipy library, we'll discover interesting places around the globe, and the OpenWeatherMap API will reveal their weather details (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed). Get ready to visualize these weather patterns with fancy scatter plots! We'll investigate if there's a connection between a city's proximity to the equator and its weather. Plus, we'll use linear regression to reveal the mathematical relationship between these variables. So grab your detective gear (figuratively speaking), because we're about to crack the weather code!



Part 2: Vacation Getaway Guru


Now that you're a weather expert, let's use your knowledge to plan your dream vacation! This part focuses on using Python to find the perfect destination based on your weather preferences. We'll utilize the geoViews library to create a map displaying hundreds of cities. Here's the fun part: the size of each city marker will reflect its humidity level, making it easy to see which places are more or less humid. Feeling particular? No worries! Share your ideal weather conditions (temperature range, wind speed, cloudiness), and we'll filter the cities to find your ideal match. To add the cherry on top, we'll use the Geoapify API to uncover hotels near your chosen destinations. 



So pack your bags, because with this Python project, your dream vacation is just a few lines of code away!
